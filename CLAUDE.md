## 2. MCP Server Integration & Configuration

### Essential MCP Servers for EPUB QA
```bash
# Core validation and automation
claude mcp add filesystem npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem
claude mcp add playwright npx @playwright/mcp@latest
claude mcp add --transport http sentry https://mcp.sentry.dev/mcp

# Quality assurance and fact-checking
claude mcp add puppeteer -s user -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer
claude mcp add --transport http context7 https://mcp.context7.com/mcp

# Database and memory for orchestration
claude mcp add sqlite npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-sqlite
claude mcp add memory npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory
```

### MCP Configuration for Professional Workflows
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sentry": {

    }
  }
}
```

```

### Complete QA Orchestration Prompt

**Copy and paste this into Claude Code for full automation:**

```text
XHTML/EPUB MANUSCRIPT QUALITY ASSURANCE ORCHESTRATOR

You are the master orchestrator for processing manuscript files using sequential agent workflow with MCP server coordination. Launch 4 specialized agents in sequence, with each building upon previous work.

INFRASTRUCTURE:
- SQLite Database: ./epub_qa.db (shared state storage)
- Memory Store: ./chain_memory (inter-agent communication)  
- File System: ./src/ or ./manuscripts/ (source files)
- MCP Servers: filesystem, sentry, playwright, sqlite, memory

SEQUENTIAL WORKFLOW:

AGENT 1: VALIDATION SPECIALIST
Mission: Validate ALL manuscript files for EPUB 3.3 compliance and W3C standards

Process:
1. Use filesystem MCP to scan for .xhtml, .html, .epub files
2. For each file:
   - Parse XHTML/HTML structure
   - Validate against W3C XHTML 1.1 DTD using playwright
   - Run EPUBCheck simulation/validation
   - Check accessibility with automated tools
   - Rate severity: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
3. Store results: INSERT INTO validation_results (file_path, validation_status, errors_found, fix_suggestions)
4. Memory handoff: 'validation_complete' with summary data

AGENT 2: ACCESSIBILITY & COMPLIANCE SPECIALIST  
Mission: Ensure WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance and European Accessibility Act requirements

Process:
1. Retrieve validation results from Agent 1
2. For each file:
   - Check alt text for images
   - Verify color contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum)
   - Test heading structure and navigation
   - Validate semantic markup
   - Simulate screen reader compatibility
3. Store results: INSERT INTO accessibility_results (file_path, wcag_compliance, issues, recommendations)
4. Memory handoff: 'accessibility_complete' with compliance status

AGENT 3: CONTENT & CONSISTENCY ANALYST
Mission: Verify factual accuracy and maintain consistency across manuscript

Process:
1. Retrieve previous agent results
2. For each file:
   - Extract factual claims, dates, references
   - Use context7/search tools for fact verification
   - Analyze cross-file consistency (characters, themes, terminology)
   - Check narrative flow and logical progression
   - Identify contradictions or gaps
3. Store results: INSERT INTO content_analysis (file_path, fact_check_status, consistency_score, issues)
4. Memory handoff: 'content_complete' with analysis summary

AGENT 4: EPUB GENERATION & FINAL QA
Mission: Generate publication-ready EPUB with comprehensive quality report

Process:
1. Integrate all previous findings
2. Generate EPUB package with corrected files
3. Run final EPUBCheck validation
4. Test cross-platform compatibility (simulate Kindle, Apple Books, etc.)
5. Generate marketing-ready metadata
6. Create comprehensive QA report with:
   - Validation status (pass/fail)
   - Accessibility compliance score
   - Content quality assessment
   - EPUB readiness certification
   - Prioritized fix recommendations

DELIVERABLE: Publication-ready EPUB + Complete QA documentation

chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

---

## 8. Advanced Features & Customization

### Custom Validation Rules

mkdir -p .claude/commands

# Custom accessibility check
echo "Enhanced accessibility validation with project-specific requirements" > .claude/commands/accessibility-plus.md

# Custom EPUB optimization

```

### Batch Processing
```bash
# Process multiple manuscripts
/batch-process --directory=./manuscripts

# Bulk validation
