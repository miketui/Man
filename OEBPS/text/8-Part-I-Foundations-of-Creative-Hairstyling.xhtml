    <p>Every masterpiece begins with a single stroke. As you turn these pages, you're not just learning techniques—you're unlocking the artistic legacy that flows through generations of visionary stylists. Here, in the crucible where science meets artistry, you'll discover why certain cuts create movement, how color theory transforms ordinary into extraordinary, and when to trust the intuition that separates good stylists from legends.</p>
    <p>These foundational chapters aren't merely about holding scissors— they're about wielding the power to transform not just hair, but confidence, identity, and self-expression. Whether you're standing behind your first chair or seeking to reinvigorate decades of experience, these timeless principles will become the compass guiding your creative journey through every trend, every client, and every challenge that lies ahead.</p>
