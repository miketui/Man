### Quality Metrics Tracking
```sql
-- Monitor agent progress
SELECT agent_name, status, completion_time FROM processing_state ORDER BY agent_sequence;

-- View quality scores by domain
SELECT 
    'Structure' as domain, AVG(validation_score) as score FROM validation_results
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'Content', AVG(confidence_score) FROM factcheck_results  
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'Accessibility', AVG(wcag_compliance_score) FROM accessibility_results
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'Template', AVG(compliance_percentage) FROM template_compliance_results
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'Publication', AVG(overall_score) FROM publication_readiness_results;
```
